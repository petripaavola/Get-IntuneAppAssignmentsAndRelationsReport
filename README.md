# üìä Intune App Assignments & Relations Report

Welcome to the **Intune App Assignments & Relations Report** project! This PowerShell script generates two comprehensive HTML reports from your Microsoft Intune environment:

- **App Assignments Report**: See all Entra ID group assignments for Intune apps, with advanced filtering and impact analysis.
- **Application Relationships Report**: Visualize app supersedence and dependencies, including automatic detection of problematic detection rules in superseded apps.

---

## üì¶ PowerShell Module Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following PowerShell modules installed:

- `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication`
- `Microsoft.Graph.Groups`
- `Microsoft.Graph.Beta.Devices.CorporateManagement`

Install all required modules with:
```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Scope CurrentUser
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Groups -Scope CurrentUser
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Beta.Devices.CorporateManagement -Scope CurrentUser
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Beta.DeviceManagement -Scope CurrentUser
```

> **Note:** You may need to update modules if you have older versions installed. Administrator rights may be required for system-wide installation.

## üöÄ Features

- **Unified view of app assignments**: See which Entra ID groups are assigned to each app, and vice versa.
- **Impact analysis**: View device and user counts for assignment groups.
- **Advanced filtering & search**: Filter by OS, app type, assignment group, and more. Free text search included.
- **Interactive HTML report**: Sort by any column, hover for details, and access direct links to Intune objects.
- **Export options**: Save results as CSV, JSON, or copy-paste to Excel.
- **Offline cache support**: Generate reports from cached data for faster results.
- **Customizable output**: Choose to include IDs, base64 images, or exclude app icons.
- **Application Relationships Report**: Visualize app supersedence and dependencies, with:
  - Automatic detection of problematic detection rules in superseded apps (shows if old and new app versions could be detected at the same time, which can cause issues for Intune Management Extension Agent).
  - Easy identification of update chains and dependency issues.

## üì¶ Installation

- **Install the required PowerShell modules** (see above).

1. **Download the script:** [Click here](https://github.com/petripaavola/Get-IntuneAppAssignmentsAndRelationsReport/blob/main/Get-IntuneAppAssignmentsAndRelationsReport.ps1)

## üìù Usage

Run the script to generate both reports:
```powershell
./Get-IntuneAppAssignmentsAndRelationsReport.ps1
```

This will create two HTML files in the current directory:
- `Intune_Application_Assignments_report.html` (App Assignments)
- `Intune_Application_Relationship_report.html` (Supersedence & Dependency)

### Microsoft Graph API Permissions

The script will prompt you to authenticate with Microsoft Graph and requires the following delegated permissions:

- `DeviceManagementApps.Read.All`
- `Group.Read.All`
- `Directory.Read.All`

Ensure your account has sufficient rights in your tenant to access Intune and Entra ID group data.
